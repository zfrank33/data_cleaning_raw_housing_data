Data Cleaning Project: Housing Data
Welcome to my GitHub repository for a data cleaning project using raw housing data. In this project, I transformed and processed raw data from the Nashville housing market to create a clean and organized dataset.

Dataset
The raw dataset used in this project consists of housing data collected over the past five years. The dataset includes information such as the location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the sale price of each property.

Cleaning Process
The raw dataset required significant cleaning and preprocessing to be suitable for analysis. The cleaning process included the following steps:

Data Validation and Standardization: I reviewed the raw data to ensure it was valid and standardized across all records. I verified that each field contained the correct data type, format, and was consistent across all records.

Handling Missing Data: I identified and handled missing data by filling in missing values with appropriate data or removing records with missing data where appropriate.

Outlier Detection and Removal: I used statistical analysis and visualization techniques to identify and remove outliers from the dataset.

Data Transformation: I transformed data as needed to make it more useful for analysis. This included converting categorical variables into numeric variables and splitting variables into multiple variables where necessary.

Results
The result of this project is a clean and organized dataset that is now suitable for analysis. The cleaned dataset can be found in the cleaned_data folder in this repository.

Conclusion
This project showcases my expertise in data cleaning and preprocessing. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis, such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. I hope this project will be useful to anyone interested in analyzing housing data.
